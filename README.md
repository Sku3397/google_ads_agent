    elements={
        'headlines': [
            'Amazing Offer - 50% Off',
            'Limited Time Deal - Save Now'
        ],
        'descriptions': [
            'Shop our collection today.',
            'Exclusive deals await.'
        ]
    },
    confidence_level=0.95

# Monitor test results
results = creative_service.monitor_creative_test(test)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Sample Size**: Ensure sufficient data before making decisions (minimum 1000 impressions per variant)
2. **Test Duration**: Run tests for at least 2 weeks to account for day-of-week variations
3. **Significance Level**: Use 95% confidence level for most tests
4. **Control Group**: Always include a control variant in tests
5. **Isolation**: Test one element at a time for clear results
