# Google Ads API Compatibility Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Deprecated Metrics Field**: The application was using a deprecated field `metrics.average_position` in queries to the Google Ads API, causing errors like:
   ```
   Google Ads API error: Request with ID 'zyHTit1pwxhHRZhst-Vj5g' failed with status 'INVALID_ARGUMENT': Unrecognized field in the query: 'metrics.average_position'.
   ```

2. **Uninitialized Variable**: In the `chat_interface.py` file, the variable `wasted_spend` was being used before it was initialized, leading to errors:
   ```
   Error generating chat response: cannot access local variable 'wasted_spend' where it is not associated with a value
   ```

3. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The error handling in `get_data_summary` method of `chat_interface.py` needed improvement to handle cases where campaign or keyword data might be missing.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed deprecated `metrics.average_position` field

In `ads_api.py`:
- Removed `metrics.average_position` from the query string in `get_keyword_performance` method
- Removed the related field assignment in the keyword dictionary creation

This ensures compatibility with the current version of the Google Ads API, which no longer supports this metric.

### 2. Fixed uninitialized variable issue

In `chat_interface.py`:
- Initialized `wasted_spend` list at the beginning of the `get_data_summary` method
- Made sure it's always initialized even when keywords are not provided or empty

### 3. Improved error handling

In `chat_interface.py`:
- Enhanced the `get_data_summary` method to:
  - Handle cases where campaigns or keywords might be missing
  - Use safer dictionary access with `.get()` and default values
  - Initialize all necessary variables
  - Add proper null checks before accessing data

### 4. Additional improvements for robustness

- Made `keywords` parameter optional in `get_data_summary` method
- Added proper default values for metrics when no data is available
- Enhanced sorting and filtering to avoid potential key errors

## Testing Performed

Tested the following functionality:
- Campaign data retrieval
- Keyword data retrieval
- Keyword analysis
- Chat interface commands

These changes ensure the application works correctly with the current version of the Google Ads API and is more robust against potential errors from missing or inconsistent data.

## Next Steps

For future maintenance:

1. **API Version Management**: Keep track of Google Ads API versions and any deprecated fields
2. **Error Handling Improvement**: Continue to improve error handling throughout the application
3. **Unit Tests**: Expand unit tests to cover more edge cases and API changes
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect current API requirements
