      Commands marked with * may be preceded by a number, _N.
      Notes in parentheses indicate the behavior if _N is given.
      A key preceded by a caret indicates the Ctrl key; thus ^K is ctrl-K.

  e  ^E  j  ^N  CR  *  Forward  one line   (or _N lines).
  y  ^Y  k  ^K  ^P  *  Backward one line   (or _N lines).
  f  ^F  ^V  SPACE  *  Forward  one window (or _N lines).
  b  ^B  ESC-v      *  Backward one window (or _N lines).
  z                 *  Forward  one window (and set window to _N).
  w                 *  Backward one window (and set window to _N).
  ESC-SPACE         *  Forward  one window, but don't stop at end-of-file.
  d  ^D             *  Forward  one half-window (and set half-window to _N).
  u  ^U             *  Backward one half-window (and set half-window to _N).
  ESC-)  RightArrow *  Right one half screen width (or _N positions).
  ESC-(  LeftArrow  *  Left  one half screen width (or _N positions).
  ESC-}  ^RightArrow   Right to last column displayed.
  ESC-{  ^LeftArrow    Left  to first column.
  F                    Forward forever; like "tail -f".
  ESC-F                Like F but stop when search pattern is found.

  R                    Repaint screen, discarding buffered input.
        ---------------------------------------------------
        Default "window" is the screen height.
        Default "half-window" is half of the screen height.
