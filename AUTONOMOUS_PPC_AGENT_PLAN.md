# Autonomous Google Ads PPC Manager - Architecture & Development Plan

## Vision Statement
To create an autonomous agent that functions as a professional Google Ads manager, analyzing campaign performance, making data-driven optimization decisions, and improving PPC results without constant human supervision.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Collection Module
- **Scheduled Data Refresh**: Automatically fetch data at optimal times (daily summaries, weekly trends)
- **Incremental Collection**: Only fetch new data since last update to minimize API calls
- **Data Validation**: Verify data integrity before analysis
- **Historical Storage**: Maintain a database of historical performance for trend analysis

### 2. Autonomous Analysis Engine
- **Multi-level Analysis**: Campaign, ad group, keyword, and ad-level performance evaluation
- **Trend Detection**: Identify performance changes over time (improvements or declines)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual performance metrics 
- **Competitive Analysis**: Compare performance against industry benchmarks where available
- **Attribution Analysis**: Evaluate which touchpoints contribute most to conversions

### 3. Decision-Making System
- **Prioritized Recommendations**: Score and rank potential optimizations by predicted impact
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assign confidence level to each recommendation
- **Auto-Implementation**: Automatically apply high-confidence recommendations
- **Learning System**: Track recommendation outcomes to improve future decisions
- **Risk Management**: Limit budget changes to safe thresholds

### 4. Reporting & Communication
- **Automated Reports**: Generate daily/weekly performance summaries
- **Alert System**: Send notifications for significant events (budget depletion, conversion drops)
- **Natural Language Explanations**: Provide plain-English rationale for all decisions
- **Interactive Chat**: Allow users to ask questions about account performance

### 5. Optimization Actions
- **Bid Management**: Auto-adjust keyword bids based on performance
- **Budget Allocation**: Shift budget to highest-performing campaigns
- **Keyword Expansion/Reduction**: Add valuable keywords, pause underperformers
- **Ad Testing**: Analyze and optimize ad copy performance
- **Audience Targeting**: Refine audience segments based on performance
- **Quality Score Improvement**: Identify and address quality score issues
