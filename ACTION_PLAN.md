## CI/CD

- [ ] Verify `.cursorci/ci.yml` exists and is correctly configured.
- [ ] Ensure CI pipeline passes with all quality gates (lint, format, types, tests, coverage >= 90%).

## Documentation

- [ ] Update `README.md` with final status and usage examples for all services.
- [ ] Ensure all public modules, classes, and functions have docstrings.

## Final Checks

- [ ] Run final `flake8 .`, `black --check .`, `mypy .`, `pytest`.
- [ ] Generate final report.
