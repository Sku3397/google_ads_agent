## 4. Chat Interface Improvements

### Command Detection and Handling
- Reordered command patterns to prioritize more specific matches first
- Fixed patterns for keyword-related commands to correctly identify different phrasings
- Added more trigger words (e.g., "give", "show", "recommend") to better match natural language queries
- Added command pattern testing to verify correct matching

### Response Generation
- Added `_process_custom_query` method to handle specific queries about account data
- Added `_generate_general_response` method for contextual responses to general queries
- Improved data context handling to ensure responses include relevant account information
- Enhanced error handling for all command processing

## 5. UI and Streamlit Updates

### Campaign and Keyword Visualization

- Implemented dynamic minimum values for bid and budget inputs
- Added fallback handling for missing or null values
- Improved handling of different suggestion types with appropriate input fields
- Enhanced visualization of changes with percentage calculations

## 6. Comprehensive Testing

- Created test scripts for all major components
- Implemented Unicode/emoji handling tests
- Added command pattern detection tests
- Created mock objects for testing without actual API calls
- Added error handling tests for edge cases

## 7. Edge Case Handling

- Added robust error handling throughout the application
- Implemented fallbacks for API failures, GPT-4 errors, and other exceptions
- Enhanced data validation to handle missing or malformed data
- Added safeguards against common failure modes
