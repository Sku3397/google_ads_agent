# Meta Learning Service

## Overview

The Meta Learning Service is a core component of the Google Ads autonomous management system. It enables the system to learn from past optimization strategies and their outcomes, adapting future strategies based on what has proven effective in similar contexts.

This service implements a system-wide learning layer that improves the effectiveness of all other services over time by tracking which strategies work best in different situations.

## Key Features

- **Strategy Performance Tracking**: Records the execution and performance of strategies from all services
- **Context-Aware Recommendations**: Recommends optimal strategies based on the current context
- **Cross-Service Pattern Analysis**: Identifies synergies and conflicts between different services
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Automatically tunes parameters for other services
- **Transfer Learning**: Applies successful strategies from one context to similar contexts
- **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Dynamically selects strategies based on historical performance

## Usage

### Recording Strategy Execution

After executing a strategy, record its outcome:

```python
meta_learning_service.record_strategy_execution(
    service_name="bid_service",
    strategy_name="performance_bidding",
    context={
        "campaign_type": "search",
        "industry": "retail",
        "budget_level": "high"
    },
    parameters={
        "target_cpa": 15.0,
        "max_cpc_increase": 0.5
    },
    results={
        "before": {
            "ctr": 0.02,
            "conversion_rate": 0.01,
            "cpa": 25.0
        },
        "after": {
            "ctr": 0.025,
            "conversion_rate": 0.015,
            "cpa": 20.0
        }
    }
)
```

### Getting Strategy Recommendations

When deciding on a strategy to use, request a recommendation:

```python
recommendation = meta_learning_service.recommend_strategy(
    service_name="bid_service",
    context={
        "campaign_type": "search",
        "industry": "retail",
        "budget_level": "medium"
    },
    available_strategies=[
        "performance_bidding",
        "target_cpa_bidding",
        "position_based_bidding"
    ]
)

# Use the recommended strategy
recommended_strategy = recommendation["recommended_strategy"]
recommended_params = recommendation["parameters"]
```

### Optimizing Hyperparameters

To find optimal hyperparameters for a strategy:

```python
def evaluate_params(params):
    # Implement evaluation function that returns a score
    # Higher score is better
    return score

optimal_params = meta_learning_service.learn_hyperparameters(
    service_name="reinforcement_learning",
    strategy_name="ppo_bidding",
    param_grid={
        "learning_rate": [0.001, 0.01, 0.1],
        "batch_size": [32, 64, 128],
        "gamma": [0.95, 0.99, 0.999]
    },
    evaluation_function=evaluate_params,
    n_trials=20
)
```

### Analyzing Cross-Service Patterns

To understand how different services interact with each other:

```python
analysis = meta_learning_service.analyze_cross_service_patterns()

# Check for synergies and conflicts
synergies = analysis["synergies"]
conflicts = analysis["conflicts"]
```

### Transfer Learning Between Contexts

To apply successful strategies from one context to another:

```python
transfer_results = meta_learning_service.transfer_learning(
    source_context={
        "campaign_type": "search",
        "industry": "retail"
    },
    target_context={
        "campaign_type": "search",
        "industry": "finance"
    }
)

# Get adapted strategies
adapted_strategies = transfer_results["adapted_strategies"]
```

## Integration with Other Services

The MetaLearningService is designed to work with all other services in the system. Services should:

1. Record their strategy executions and outcomes with the MetaLearningService
2. Request strategy recommendations before applying optimizations
3. Leverage the MetaLearningService for hyperparameter optimization

## Technical Details

- Uses similarity matching to find relevant historical contexts
- Implements basic meta-learning algorithms with potential for extension
- Stores historical strategy performance in a structured format
- Supports machine learning models for strategy recommendation

## Future Enhancements

- More sophisticated similarity calculations using embedding models
- Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning
- Multi-armed bandit approaches for strategy exploration/exploitation
- Integration with reinforcement learning for closed-loop optimization
